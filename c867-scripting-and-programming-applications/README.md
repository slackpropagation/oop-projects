# Class Roster

This repository contains my completed work for the C867 Scripting and Programming â€“ Applications project at Western Governors University (WGU). The project was completed in C++.

## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to apply object-oriented programming principles in C++ to create a student roster system. The program demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance, arrays, and other core OOP concepts.

## Key Components

- `student.h/.cpp`: Class definitions for student objects
- `degree.h`: Enum for degree programs (SECURITY, NETWORK, SOFTWARE)
- `roster.h/.cpp`: Core logic to manage a dynamic array of student objects
- `main.cpp`: Driver program to load data, process the roster, and call required functions

### Functionality

- Parsing and storing student data
- Printing all students
- Printing invalid emails
- Calculating average days in course
- Filtering by degree program
- Removing a student by ID

## Tools Used

- C++ (GCC / Clang)
- Visual Studio Code / CLion
- Git & GitHub for version control
- macOS Terminal or Linux Bash

## What I Learned

- Designing and implementing classes in C++
- Using arrays and pointers effectively
- Managing object lifecycles and memory (constructors/destructors)
- Modular programming across multiple source files
- Applying basic software development principles like separation of concerns and version control
